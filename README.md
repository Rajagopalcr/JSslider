Hi,

This is a simple jQuery slider plugin.

You can see the basic example in slider.html

You can move forward/backward by swiping from left to right and vice versa using mouse.

You can select the slider by tabing and can do forward/backward by keyboard arrows as well.

It also provides an option for slideshow (autoslide : true, by default it will be false).

Example: 

	$("#sli").slider({
		files : _temp,
		width : 700,
		height : 400,
		autoslide : true,
	});
